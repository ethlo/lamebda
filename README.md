A simple, powerful, plugin system for adding new API endpoints or custom functionality to you Spring project. 
Oftentimes there are conflicting requirements when utilizing a common main application. The required custom functionality needed is often easy to do with a few lines of code, but is not acceptable to add to your main code-base. With Lamebda you can load libraries with custom functionality.

## Example use-cases

* Ad-hoc API services and integration projects - Changes in the integration code can evolve freely from the core service
* Transactional support across multiple API calls
* Batch multiple API calls to avoid chatty data exchange
* API prototyping
* A powerful support tool for extracting data or changing state.

## Getting started

### Integrating with your project


#### Usage with Spring Boot and Spring MVC

Add dependency to your `pom.xml`
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.ethlo.lamebda</groupId>
    <artifactId>lamebda-spring-web-starter</artifactId>
    <version>{$lamebda_version}</version>
</dependency>
```

Add the following properties to your applications `application.properties|yaml`:
```properties
lamebda.enabled=true
lamebda.root-directory=/var/lib/lamebda
lamebda.request-path=/gateway
```

### Project configuration
`project.properties`
* `project.name` - Human-readable name of the project. Optional.
* `project.base-packages` - The base packages that Spring IOC container is scanning for services and controllers.
* `project.root-request-path-enabled` - Default is true. If you set this to false, the URLs in this project will not have the prepended `gateway` path.
* `project.url-prefix-enabled` - Default is true. If you set this to false the URLs in this project will not have the prepended project alias.


To create a project for deploying into Lamebda, please see https://github.com/ethlo/lamebda-samples.

### Monitoring
The loaded project(s) can be monitored using a custom [Actuator](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/actuator/index.html) endpoint, under `/actuator/lamebda`.
